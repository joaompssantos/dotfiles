== Overview

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Linux and Unix-like systems. These files configure my shell, editor, terminal, and other tools to create a consistent and productive environment across machines.

== Features

* Shell configuration (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)
* Editor settings (e.g., `.vimrc`, `.config/nvim/init.vim`)
* Git configuration (`.gitconfig`, `.gitignore_global`)
* Tmux and screen settings
* Custom scripts (in `bin/` or `scripts/`)
* Application configs (e.g., `.config/` for various apps)

== Installation

Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
----

Symlink the files to your home directory (example):

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow bash vim git tmux
----

Or use your preferred symlink method or install script.

== Bootstrap Script

A `bootstrap.sh` script is provided to check for required dependencies and set up your environment. It detects your Linux distribution (Gentoo, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, etc.) and installs missing packages using the appropriate package manager.
